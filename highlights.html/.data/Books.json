Although I haven\u2019t the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I began by asking the other party whether he believed the date of one\u2019s birth has anything to do with character and disposition. I then asked him or her to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she said November 24, for example, I kept repeating to myself, \u2018November 24, November 24.\u2019 The minute my friend\u2019s back was turned I wrote down the name and birthday and later would transfer it to a birthday book. At the beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates scheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my attention automatically. When the natal day arrived, there was my letter or telegram. What a hit it made! I was frequently the only person on earth who remembered. If we want to make friends, let\u2019s greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the same psychology. Say \u2018Hello\u2019 in tones that bespeak how pleased you are to have the person call. Many companies train their telephone operators to greet all callers in a tone of voice that radiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is concerned about them. Let\u2019s remember that when we answer the telephone tomorrow.",
